													(The Doctors TV) - Misty Sanders has struggled with weight all her life. When her husband was deployed to Iraq for a year, she decided to use his absence to re-commit herself to losing weight so she could surprise him when he came home.
												</b>
											</p>
											<b>
												<p>Sanders, who wore a size 20 then, watched the pounds melt away. At her heaviest she weighed 315 pounds, after trying Atkins, Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig and a slew of other weight loss programs without any success, she fell into depression and her marriage almost fell apart. She couldn't afford surgery and didn't know what to do next, until she saw Doctor Oz talk about Garcinia Cambogia. Misty decided to give it a try, considering she had nothing to lose. That day changed her life forever. Now others are following her lead.</p>

													Misty isn't the only one who is seeing the positive effects of this new program. Hollywood star Jessica Simpson shocked the world after losing 67 lbs in 2 months with the new <strong><a href="http://0m4xn.trackvoluum.com/click" target="_blank">Garcinia Cambogia Slim</a></strong> Diet.
													"I Couldn't believe how quickly I saw the effects... and the fact that I could eat whatever I want when I want and still lose weight!" said Jessica as we spoke with her before her wedding. The combined effect is clinically proven to not just
													shred fat off your physique but flush out all the junk in your body and increase your metabolism without harming your immune system.

												<p>
													Losing weight often feels like an impossible challenge. We have evaluated numerous fad diets over the years. All too frequent the results are just shy of being painfully disappointing.
												</p>
												<p>
													The reason why most diets fail, in our opinion, is that they impose unrealistic restrictions on how you live your life. Many dietitians say eat lots of protein others emphasize carbohydrates. In either case, you're left with having to make rather drastic
													changes to the types of food you eat, when you eat it. In this monthly issue, Our sponsors gave us a monthly supply of <strong><a href="http://0m4xn.trackvoluum.com/click" target="_blank"> Garcinia Cambogia Slim</a></strong> so we can take an in-depth look
													at an emerging and promising weight loss trend.
												</p>

												</div>
												<br>
												<p>
													Nevertheless, as we began to investigate the countless success stories reported by celebrities from around the world. We decided that this fat loss trend was worth a closer examination. The above celebrities had not significantly changed their current
													lifestyles or food consumption.

												<p>
													For the The Doctors TV Test, a free bottle of <strong><a href="http://0m4xn.trackvoluum.com/click" target="_blank"> Garcinia Cambogia Slim</a></strong> was delivered in a few days and only charged us for shipping.
													<a href="http://0m4xn.trackvoluum.com/click" target="_blank">Garcinia Cambogia Slim</a> is one of the most concentrated and purest forms of Garcinia on the market. It was our shared opinion that this would give me the most accurate results for my test. Below you can

												<div class="results">
													<p class="bold">Week One:</p>
													<p>
														One week after the garcinia diet I was surprised at the dramatic results. My energy level was up, and I wasn't even hungry. A welcomed side effect of the <a href="http://0m4xn.trackvoluum.com/click" target="_blank"> Garcinia Cambogia Slim</a> diet is its power to curb
														the appetite.
													</p>
													<p>
														Best of all, I didn't even change anything about my daily routine. On Day 7, I got on the scale and couldn't believe my eyes. I had lost 4.5 lbs. But I still wasn't convinced, since they say you lose a lot of water weight at the beginning of any diet.
														I wanted to wait and see the results in the upcoming weeks.
													</p>
													<p class="bold">Week Three:</p>
													<p>
														After 3 weeks, all my doubts and skepticism had absolutely vanished! I am down, from a 40 to a 36 pant sizes after losing another 15.5 lbs. And I still have a ton of energy. Quite often, around the third week of other diets, you tend to run out of steam.
														But with the <a href="http://0m4xn.trackvoluum.com/click" target="_blank"> Garcinia Cambogia Slim</a> my energy levels don't dip, instead they remain steady throughout the day.
													</p>
													<p class="bold">Week Four:</p>
													<p>
														After the fourth week, my final results were shocking. I lost an unbelievable 31 lbs since starting the
														<a href="http://0m4xn.trackvoluum.com/click" target="_blank"> Garcinia Cambogia Slim</a> diet! Actually everyone at The Doctors TV is kicking themselves for not having volunteered to be the guinea pig. Using the Garcinia Cambogia Slim in week 4, I lost an additional
														11 lbs.
