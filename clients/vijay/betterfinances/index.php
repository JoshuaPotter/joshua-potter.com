					<p>Massachusetts — New policies are indicating that for years many Massachusetts drivers have likely overpaid on their car insurance.
						<br><br> This is the 1 simple truth your car insurance company doesn't want you to know. If you <strong>drive less than 50 miles/day and live in a qualified zip code</strong> you can get an extremely high discount. Additionally, if you have no DUI's,
						you can get even more discounts. But do you think your auto insurance company will tell you that?
						<br><br> When drivers enter their zip code and driver information at <a href="click.php" target="_blank">Provide Savings™ official site</a> many are shocked at the results they find. Most just cannot believe that the available
						rates are in fact real, but the truth is rates have dropped significantly over the past 12 months and thanks to new program policies it's now easy to <strong>save up to 50% with rates as low as $29/month</strong>.
						<br><br> Nikki Johnson, the authority on everything related to insurance, set out to do some research and determine whether these types of services live up to their reputations. After several weeks Nikki was able to report back on her findings,
						with her most exciting of which being that she is now going to save $296.28 on her own insurance premiums over the next year, and there are many other people who have done the same and better.
						<br><br>
						<strong>So, what is the "One New Rule?"</strong> NEVER buy insurance without <a href="click.php" target="_blank">comparing all of the discounts online</a> first. </p>

					<p>Does this mean Nikki was being overcharged by her former insurance agent? She would not say one way or the other, but the truth is most agents are paid on commission which means the higher your insurance premiums, the more money your agent makes.
						You can be sure, however, that your insurance company is not going to call you up to offer you a discount.
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>Note: You're NEVER LOCKED into your current policy. If you've already paid your current policy, you can very easily cancel and the balance will be refunded.
						</p>
					</blockquote>
