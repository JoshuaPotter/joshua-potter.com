						<p><b><span class="txtBlk">Welcome To The Future,</span></b> - a new (and highly advanced) brain supplement is sending shock-waves around the world. Major pharmacy companies are in chaos because they have zero control over what scientists are saying
							is "Viagra for the brain". It’s called <b><a href="step-1.php">Evo™</a></b>(medical name E-Huperzine), and the results are more than enough to give the latest superheroes a run for their money.</p>
						<p>There’s already controversy revolving around the memory-enhancing pill, which was inspired by the movie limitless. Around the time of its release, the use of <b><a href="step-1.php">Evo™</a></b> became widespread amongst
							young professionals. Specifically men aged between 25-40 benifited the most as the effects were amplified due to the ingredients reaction to a gene called NRXN3 in the male brain. Men reported having "laser beam focus" and were thinking sharper,
							improving their memory and turbo charging their energy levels. Even more appealing and controversial was how the pills helped men effortlessly attract and seduce beautiful women with their new found quick wit and charm.</p>
						<p><b><a href="step-1.php"> Evo™</a></b> became known as the most powerful self-development trick on earth and was heavily praised by Gary Stix as the missing link in human evolution in his report "Turbo-charging the brain".
							Not long after, everyone from quiz show contestants to university students were taking this pill to boost their brain and achieve peak performance in little time.</p>

						<p>100% NATURAL – that’s good, right? Yes, if you’re looking for a healthy way to increase your cognitive abilities. But a big pharmacy company who feels threatened by this breakthrough in brain health, is scrambling to put a stop to it before the
							public catches on and it’s too late.Why is this tiny pill protected from legislation? Simply put, it’s absurd to make vitamins, minerals, or bee pollen illegal. That means as of right now, anyone can indulge in this brain supplement without a prescription
							or hefty price tag.</p>
						<section class="article-quote" id="left">
							<div class="quoteArrow"></div>"Simply Amazing!
							<br>Incredible focus, memory, and energy..."</section>
						<p>Critics say the problem is – everyone wants to have a better brain, and improve their memory, so it’s only a matter of time before this pill starts getting abused. While abuse of any supplement is nothing to joke about, I think having several more
							“brainiacs” or Albert Einsteins around is the last thing we have to worry about.

						<h1>We tested it ourselves - is it all hype?</h1>
						<p>With so much media praise and countless reviews of people experiencing success with <b><a href="step-1.php">Evo™</a></b>, My Life &amp; Health wanted to verify whether this was all hype. After almost every single man
							in the building volunteered to test it out but we chose our Senior Chief Editor Alan Frasier. Below is his account of using <b><a href="step-1.php">Evo™</a></b> over a 4 week period.</p>
						<h2> Summary of Alan's Evo Pills experience</h2>
						<p>The Evo pills were extremely hard to come by. We had to wait 2 weeks before we got a bottle to test as it was sold out almost everywhere or over $300 a bottle from people trying to sell it for profit on ebay. People were paying top dollar for them
							on there.</p>
						<p>My first impressions were the packaging of the pills didn't match what I have been hearing. With the picture of the brain and Evo written in red, the bottle looked a bit too party pill style. But, I took one and forgot about it.</p>
						<p>Maybe 20-30 minutes later I felt odd. I can only describe it by saying my mind felt calm and still. It was like that feeling you get when you have just woken up. Light headed so to speak but this was different. I was light headed and spaced out
							but in the zone at the same time. Can't explain it - but it was awesome.</p>
						<p>Over the course of 4 weeks I found myself bouncing out of bed and felt ready to take on the day - usually I need to snooze 3 times. I felt motivated to get stuff done and often power through.</p>
						<p>My thoughts on Evo are that despite the horrible look of the bottle(we have been joking a lot in the office) the pills are the real deal. I've tried modafinil and other smart drugs but this is by far the closest feeling like you are Bradley Cooper
							from Limitless. Since then 90% of us have subscriptions to make sure we never run out as I hear very few people can get a hold of these.</p>
						<p>If you happen to come across these, you can move on with your day and your life or you can spare 2 minutes and take what is the most important step to becoming what you wanna be</p>
						<p>**Because of recent coverage, supplies are running low. You can check to see if Evo is still available here</p>
						<p><b>Evo was recently given hoary mention in Forbes' printed and online magazine editions as being the pill that can turn you into 'the quickest thinker on the planer.'</b>

						<h1>Should Evo be legal?</h1>
						<p id="p1">When Evo was originally banned a lot of people were angry. There were no side effects then and as it stands there are no side effects with the stronger formula. Even the pill from Limitless had side effects and that was make-believe. That sad, all
							our users followed the directions and did not go overboard so it's strongly recommended to use common sense when taking these</p>
						<p>Evo is the only pill of it's kind where the user benefits and grows the more he takes. Normally the body gets used to most medications but throughout all trials all users made continued progress as the weeks went on.</p>
						<p>In regards to whether these should be legal? Yes they should. In fact, they never should have been banned. The truth is the health and safety of the product was never a concern. Major competing companies created uproar due to their heavily sinking
							profits when Evo was becoming widely used. Even more companies are joining in this time so we have no doubt that production of Evo pills will be stopped once again.</p>
						<p>The question is, <b><a href="step-1.php"> will you be one of the lucky few who have their hands on the next step of human evolution?</a></b>

							<span class="resultsSub lrgBoxBG"><img src="./brain-enhancer_files/bulletCheck.png" width="18" height="15" style="border:none!important">Week One</span>
							<p>After one week of using Evo I am beyond surprised at the dramatic results. My energy level is up, and it’s not like a typical coffee rush. This is a smooth boost of long-lasting, natural energy without the crash… I love it! My brain honestly felt
								CLEAR for the first time in years, and this was just after a few short days.</p>
							<p>On day 7 I woke up feeling like a new and improved me. I had one of the most productive weeks I could remember, and I felt like I owed it all to this tiny pill. But I was still a little skeptical. Was this really all from taking Evo? The only way
								to find out was to continue my test, but I must admit I’m excited. If this week wasn’t a fluke things are definitely looking up for me!</p>
							<span class="resultsSub"><img src="./brain-enhancer_files/bulletCheck.png" width="18" height="15" style="border:none!important">Week Two</span>
							<p>After two weeks of using Evo, I am feeling even more focused and energized than before. Today I had what I would of called a “long day” and it hasn’t even fazed me! I am more focused right now (after a 10hr work day) than I would normally be waking
								up. I must admit that I’m starting to believe that this more than just a gimmick.</p>
							<p>Keep in mind, I have made absolutely no change to my diet, exercise, or work schedule. This has all been the result of literally doing nothing except taking Evo.</p>
							<span class="resultsSub"><img src="./brain-enhancer_files/bulletCheck.png" width="18" height="15" style="border:none!important">Week Three</span>
							<p>After three weeks all my doubts and skepticism have absolutely vanished! I’m still experiencing a climb in focus, and my memory is sharper than ever.</p>
							<p>Around the third week of using any supplement, I would expect to run out of steam. But with Evo my energy levels haven’t dipped at all. They remain steady throughout the day. I no longer need that cat nap around 3 p.m. in the afternoon!</p>
							<span class="resultsSub"><img src="./brain-enhancer_files/bulletCheck.png" width="18" height="15" style="border:none!important">Week Four</span>
							<p>After the fourth week, my final results were amazing. My memory is crystal-clear, and my levels of focus and concentration have been through the roof! Actually everyone at Student Success Daily is kicking themselves for not having volunteered to
								be the guinea pig. Even though my test is over, with the results I’ve experienced over the last month I am obviously going to continue taking Evo… and I highly suggest anyone who ever reads this does the same!</p>

								<h3 class="testimonial">"All my friends kept telling me about how amazing this Evo stuff is. I've had trouble with losing concentration since middle school, so you can imagine how desperate I was to finally feel as great as my friends seemed to every day. I finally tried Evo, and let me tell you, I will NEVER try another thing again! This stuff is incredible! I now for the first time feel like I'm capable of anything!"</h3>

								<h3 class="testimonial">"As a father of 3, I juggle work, kids, and all of life's other stresses on a daily basis. I've had a busy lifestyle ever since I started having a family due to having no time, but no matter how hard I tried there was just never enough time to get things done. A friend of mine brought me Evo one morning - I couldn't believe how quick it started working &amp; how I felt like an unstoppable freight train! Thanks Evo - You're a real life saver!"</h3>
