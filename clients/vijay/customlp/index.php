							</a>(<?php include '/geoip/city.php'; ?>): Are you being scammed by your current insurer? If you don’t think that you’re being ripped off by your current insurance company, you will be shocked by these details. Imagine the savings you would have seen over time had you followed this one simple rule... </p>
						<p>This is the one simple truth your car insurance company doesn’t want you to know: Drivers should never buy insurance without first comparing all available discounts. If you are currently insured, have no DUI’s, drive less than 40 miles/day and have an address in the USA you may be eligible for huge discounts. But do you think your auto insurance company would ever tell you that? 
						</p>
						<p>When Janet, a school teacher visited <a href="auto-insurance.php">Provide Insurance™ official site</a> and entered her zip code, she was shocked by the results. She learned that her local insurance agent had ripped her off and that she was eligible for car insurance rates at a far lower price. </p> 
						<p>“We managed to reduce our insurance premium by 50%! I only wish we had discovered this sooner.” Janet exclaimed. </p>
						<p>What did Janet do to get this insanely high discount? She used <a href="auto-insurance.php">Provide Insurance™</a> to compare all of the insurance policies she was eligible for. Within seconds, she was shown the different rates that all of the popular insurance companies offered for the criteria she put in. And this is when she found out she was overpaying. 
						</p>
						<p>We weren’t surprised when we got asked by drivers if these rates are real. Truthfully, many drivers are eligible for rates as low as $9/ week due to recent insurance policy changes. Upon hearing these claims, we decided to investigate it for ourselves.</p>
						<p>So, what is the "One Simple Rule?" You should <strong>NEVER</strong> buy car insurance without comparing all of the discounts available to you through an unbiased source.
