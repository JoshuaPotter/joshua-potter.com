                        <b><span class="txtBlk">'Welcome To The Future'</span></b> -  American business magnates, investors and billionaires donât let their age affect any of there decision making or business solutions. Instead, they rely on a lesser known âsecretâ to aid them where they are now today. The secret? A brain pill. Many business moguls have admitted to using these products to help keep their minds intact. Weâre not saying you can be rich like these billionaires instantly, but it will enhance your memory, critical thinking, and focus, which in turn will lead you down the path of success. <b><a class="link" href="" target="_blank">SmartX</a></b> (<em>by Cerebral Success</em>), is the most widely used âsmartâ pill and the results are more than enough to give the latest superheroes a run for their money.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There's already been previous controversy around brain-enhancing pills, which was the inspiration for the movie Limitless, and Lucy. Heavily praised by Gary Stix as 'the missing link in human evolution' in his report <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/turbocharging-the-brain/" target="_blank">'</a><a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/turbocharging-the-brain/" target="_blank">Turbo-charging the Brain', </a>when released, the use of âsmartâ pills became widespread amongst adults looking to stay sharp with age and young professionals looking to get ahead. Specifically, adult men benefited the most as the effects were amplified due to the ingredientsâ reaction to a gene called NRXN3 in the male brain. Men reported having <strong>'laser beam focus' </strong>, were <strong>thinking sharper, recalling information easier</strong> and <strong>feeling mentally charged and alert</strong>. Even more appealing and controversial was how customers claimed these pills helped them to attract and seduce beautiful women with their new found quick wit and charm.
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                        After an appearance on Shark Tank that saw the company win an investment from Barbara Corcoran, <b><a class="link" href="" target="_blank">SmartX</a></b> soon became known as the âmost powerful self-development trick on earthâ. The hype over this new âsmartâ pill only grew after premium US vitamin retailers such as GNC rushed to stock up on <b><a class="link" href="" target="_blank">SmartX</a></b> after the Shark Tank appearance. Soon everyone from quiz show contestants to university students were taking the pill to <strong>ramp up their IQ</strong>, <strong>increase their salary</strong> and <strong>achieve peak performance</strong> in little time.
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
<b><a class="link" href="" target="_blank">SmartX</a></b>, which has no recorded side effects in any trials, was soon the topic of major media controversy. Critics argue the effects of <b><a class="link" href="" target="_blank">SmartX</a></b> cause such dramatic cognitive results that they are ripe for abuse by students who are just looking to ace their next exam. Proponents of <b><a class="link" href="" target="_blank">SmartX</a></b> claim that scientific studies have proven the ingredients to be effective and safe, and that banning natural brain enhancers would be akin to banning vitamins.

                        After years of research and study on the ingredients within <b><a class="link" href="" target="_blank">SmartX</a></b>, the âsuperhero makingâ drug is now more powerful than ever. The secret to the pillâs improved formula? Cognizin.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Never heard of it? Neither had we. In a very recent study on Cognizin published in the <a href="http://file.scirp.org/Html/8-2700397_19921.htm" target="_blank">'</a><a href="http://file.scirp.org/Html/8-2700397_19921.htm" target="_blank">Food and Nutrition Sciences Journal'</a>, adults taking Cognizin (<em>Medical Name: Citicoline</em>) were able to reduce errors of commission by 50% and reduce errors of omission by 87%!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Combining this with the already powerful ingredients of <b><a class="link" href="" target="_blank">SmartX</a></b>, and your mind will be clearer than that of a Zen-monkâs. Your ability to focus and power through your to-do list will also be a thing of the past and after consistent use, you will become the perfect youthful version of yourself. Many people thought something like this wouldnât exist for another hundred years but as Dr Raqif said: <a class="link" href="" target="_blank">welcome to the future</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Critics of the pill are of course making their voices heard and if the effectiveness of <b><a class="link" href="" target="_blank">SmartX</a></b> is even stronger than it previously was then these âsmartâ pills will not be around much longer. With such a powerful opportunity to regain your youthful quick thinking, master your emotions and boost your salary, it's only a matter of time before <b><a class="link" href="" target="_blank">SmartX</a></b> pills are the target of major pharmaceutical companies who are seeing a decline in profits.<br><br>

                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        With so much media praise and countless reviews of people experiencing success with <b><a class="link" href="" target="_blank">SmartX</a></b> we wanted to verify whether this was just hype. Almost every single man in the building volunteered to test it out we chose our Senior Chief Editor Alan Paul. Below is his account of using <b><a class="link" href="" target="_blank">SmartX</a></b> over a 4 week period.
                    </p>
                    <h2 align="center">
                        Summary of Alanâs SmartX pills experience
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                       The SmartX pills were extremely hard to come by. We had to wait 2 weeks before we got a bottle to test as it was sold out almost everywhere. At one point I considered ordering it on ebay where it was selling for over $300 a bottle from people trying to sell it for a profit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My first impression of SmartX wasnât anything specialâa clean looking white bottle with a sharp looking black label arrived in the mail with 30 orange capsules inside. It didnât look like much to be honest but I took two capsules and forgot about it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Maybe 20-30 minutes later I felt odd. I can only describe it by saying my mind felt calm and still. It was like that feeling you get when you have just woken up. Light headed so to speak but this was different. I was light headed and spaced out but in the zone at the same time. Canât explain it - but it was awesome.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over the course of the 4 weeks I found myself bouncing out of bed and felt ready to take on the day - usually I need to hit the snooze button a few times. I felt some strange deep motivation to get stuff done and power through the day when I would normally feel tired or lazy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Things that annoyed me were no longer an issue, I suddenly felt like I was in complete control of my life. I hardly got stressed and when I did, I was able to control my emotions and get back into peak performance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My thoughts on SmartX...for something that works as well as SmartX, youâd expect it to cost a lot more...itâs the real deal. Iâve tried modafinil, adderall and other smart drugs but this is by far the closest thing to feeling like you are Bradley Cooper from Limitless.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I ordered 5 more bottles as a <strong>special discount (which Iâve shared below)</strong> to make sure I never run out as I hear <a class="link" href="" target="_blank">very few people can get a hold of these</a>. Unfortunately for me, a week later some of my coworkers found out about it and decided to hand out all my pills to everybody in the office...so much for that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you happen to come across these you can move along with your day and go about your life or you can spare 2 minutes and take what is <strong>the most important step to becoming the man you want to be</strong>.

                    <h1>Should SmartX be legal?</h1>
                    <p>
                        SmartX has never had side effects and as it stands there are no side effects with the stronger formula. Here are clinical studies of the main ingredients in this product (<a href="http://www.ajpcr.com/Vol4Suppl1/496.pdf" target="_blank">Clinical Study #1</a>, <a href="http://www.balazs-gulyas.hu/files/67_Vas_vinpocetine_2002.pdf" target="_blank">Clinical Study #2</a>). That said, all our users followed the directions and did not go overboard so itâs strongly recommended to use common sense when taking these.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        SmartX is the only pill of itâs kind where the user benefits and grows the more he takes. Normally the body gets used to most medications but throughout all trials all users made continued progress as the weeks went on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In regards to whether these should be legal? Yes they should. In fact, the pharmaceutical companies that want to ban SmartX already know this. The truth is the âhealth and safetyâ of the product was never a concern. Major competing companies created uproar due to their heavily sinking profits when SmartX was released. Unfortunately, more companies continue to join in the fight so we have no doubt that production of SmartX pills will be halted soon.

                        <p>
                            The first day of taking SmartX was an experience in itself. I started to feel a sense of calm after about 15 minutes. 30 Minutes later I had what felt like 360 degrees vision. My mind was clear and calm. Nothing like coffee.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After one week of using SmartX my energy levels are up, and it's not like a typical coffee rush. This is a smooth boost of long-lasting, natural energy without the crashâ¦ I love it! My brain honestly feels CLEAR for the first time in years, and this was just after a few short days.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I woke up today (day 7) feeling like a new and improved me. I had one of the most productive weeks I could remember and  felt like I owed it all to this tiny pill.  But to be honest, i'm still a little skeptical. If this week wasn't a fluke things are definitely looking up for me but I am reserving judgement.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            After two weeks of using SmartX, I'm feeling even more focused and energized than before. Today I had what I would have called a "long day" and it hasn't even bothered me! I'm more focused right now (after a 10hr work day) than I would normally be waking up.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm bouncing out of bed. I wake up earlier without an alarm. It's great. I always woke up lethargic and like a zombie. Thinking about it now, that hasn't happened once. I literally wake up and i'm ready to take on the day. It's a truly unique experience.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My focus and concentration is pretty damn good. But I found I need to set alarms otherwise it is very easy to get carried away. Yesterday I want meant to meet some friends but was so absorbed in work. Good thing for focus. But alarms are a must.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My stress levels also seem down. Not sure if this is unrelated as I haven't been as stressed since I started this. So not sure if it is because of the pill that I am not stressed or not.

                        <p>
                            I looked back on my results at the end of this week and realized that this is the read deal! Well done. I am very happy right now. Haven't stopped smiling. I'm just always on. I'm always in control. Yesterday at work we had a major project deadline we weren't going to hit and I was the only one who was in control out of the entire teamâIncluding my boss. I literally feel like I am mastering my emotions. I'm still experiencing a climb in focus and my memory is sharper than ever too.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Around the third week of using any supplement, I would expect to run out of steam due to the body getting used to the ingredients. But my energy levels haven't dipped at all. They remain steady throughout the day. I no longer need that cat nap around 3 p.m. in the afternoon!
                        </p>

                        </span>
                        <p>
                            After the fourth week, my final results were amazing. My memory is crystal-clear, and my levels of focus and concentration have been through the roof!  Even though my test is over, with the results I've experienced over the last month I am obviously going to continue taking SmartX if possible.
                        </p>
                        <p>Side effects wise: none but you need to set an alarm to remind yourself of other work that needs to be done. You could get wrapped up in a passion project very easily.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I love this stuff. I have no stress these days, I sleep less, wake up ready and energized and as for the brain games I have been playing...my scores have tripled which is awesome! love seeing the graph and how it shows my IQ has sky rocketed.
                        </p>
                        <p>Hands down, the best decision I made was ordering a bottle. I plan to use these for the rest of my life if possible.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Otherwise I might feel like a God who lost his powers!</p>
                        <p>
                            Ok that's a bit dramatic but the point is, these are great. Well done once again.

I am definitely going to try the special offer before it expires! Thanks for sharing the tips. Super excited!.</p>

                                <p> There is a big stir going on these days about SmartX and my guess is it's not going to stop. I am seeing SmartX all over.. they were giving out free samples at the mall today and the stand sure did have a crowd. Thanks to the special offer you posted I saved over $112. Thanks for the links Doc! </p>

                                <p> stand by this pill. I tried SmartX about a month ago and I can't say enough about it. This helped me gain an edge in life i felt like i had lost forever. It completely brought back joy in my life. (I have been waiting for something like this for a long time). I highly recommend this to ANYONE that's looking for a product that actually WORKS. </p>

Love it. Thank you. I've had trouble with losing concentration since middle school, so you can imagine how desperate I was to finally feel as great as my friends seemed to every day. I finally tried SmartX, and let me tell you, I will NEVER try another thing again! This stuff is incredible! For the first time I feel like I'm capable of anything! Thank you so much!"

I've had a busy lifestyle ever since I started having a family due to having no time, but no matter how hard I tried there was just never enough time to get things done.
