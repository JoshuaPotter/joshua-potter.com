- This is the 1 simple truth your car insurance company doesn't want you to know. 
If you currently have insurance, are driving less than 40 miles/day on average and live in a qualified 
zip code you can get some huge discounts. In addition, if you have no DUI's on your record, 
you can get even more discounts. Has your car insurance company ever told you that? </span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 32px; line-height: normal;">
  When  drivers enter their zip code at <a href="http://saferule.com/base2.php" target="_blank">AutoCar Insurance
    </a> many are shocked at the results they find. 
  Most just cannot believe that the available rates are in fact real, but the truth 
  is rates have dropped significantly over the past 12 months and thanks to new 
  program policies it's now easy to save up to 32% or more with rates as low as $2<span style="color: #000000">9</span>/month.  
</span></p><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="color: #000000;">

<p><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 32px; line-height: normal;"> 
Jessica Wagner, the authority on everything related to insurance, set out to do some 
research and determine whether these types of services live up to their 
reputations. After several weeks Jessica was able to report back on her findings, with 
her most exciting of which being that she is now going to save $296.28 on 
her own insurance premiums over the next year, and there are many other people 
who have done the same and better. 
</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 32px; line-height: normal;">
So, what is the <strong>"One Simple Rule?" NEVER buy car insurance without 
comparing all of the discounts</strong> available to you through an unbiased 
source. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://saferule.com/base2.php" target="_blank"><img src="images/savingsexample.jpg" alt="" width="866" height="296" /></a></p>

</span></span>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 32px; line-height: normal;">Does this 
mean Jessica was being <span style="color: #000000">o</span>vercharged by her former insurance agent? She would not say one 
way or the other, but the truth is most agents are paid on commission which 
means the higher your insurance premiums, the more money your agent makes. You 
can be sure, however, that your insurance company is not going to call you up to 
offer you a discount.
</span></p>
<span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="color: #000000;">


<p><span style="background-color: #ffff00;"><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 32px; line-height: normal;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>FACT: Drivers who don't compare rates are overpaying on average $368 each year. <a href="http://saferule.com/base2.php" target="_blank">Click here</a> and save now!</strong></span></span> </span></p>


<p><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 32px; line-height: normal;"><span style="color: #000000;">Based on these 
findings it is evident that the only way to get the discounted rates you 
deserve is to take matters into your own hands. Smart consumers already know 
this, and as a rule, are now choosing to use online tools to receive unbiased 
insurance quotes fast and hassle free. 
</span></span></p>

<p>Hildlife.com is a general interest website containing articles 
about a wide variety of subjects. Many of these articles are what is commonly 
referred to as Advertorials.</p>

<p>The term "advertorial" is a combination of "advertisement" and "editorial" 
written in an editorial format as an independent news story, when in fact the 
advertisement may promote a particular product or interest. Advertorials take 
factual information and report it in an editorial format to allow the author, 
often a company marketing its products, to enhance or explain certain elements 
to maintain the reader's interest. A familiar example is an airline's in-flight 
magazines that provide an editorial reports about travel destinations to which 
the airline flies.</p>
