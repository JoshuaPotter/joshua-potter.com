							<strong>(Healthy Fitness + Money)</strong> – Amidst one of the toughest economic times in history, thrifty shoppers are turning to the internet to take advantage of special offers.
						</p>
						<p>Jessica, a school teacher and full time mother, is one such shopper.  It all started about three months ago when she bought an authentic Coach purse on sale for only $35 (75% off the retail price).  She was determined to seek out other great offers and recently made her best find.  Jessica discovered a clever way of combining two different teeth whitening offers from the same companies – <a href="./step-1.php" target="_blank">Pearl-E-Whites Pen</a> and <a href="./step-2.php" target="_blank">Pearl-E-Whites Tray</a> – to get results similar to that of a professional whitening done by a dentist.  Rather then spending $500 at her local dentist to attain a sexy smile, she was able to do so for less than $3 by using Risk Free Trial offers she found online.</p>
						<p>
							Jessica: “I like to consider myself a smart shopper, always finding the best bang for my buck. My online teeth whitening discovery was without a doubt one of the best finds I made this year.”
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>How did Jessica wind up with yellow teeth? </strong>
						</p>
						<p><em>While my mom always told me be to be proud of who I am and what I look like, I have always been self conscious about my yellow teeth. Truthfully, I have no one to blame for this problem but myself. I smoked for 8 years, drink 2 cups of coffee a day (only way to stay awake at work), and love a glass of red wine to help me sleep at night.  Furthermore, I would be lying if I said that I brushed my teeth 3 times a day every day.  While I recently quit smoking and have cut back on the amount of coffee I drink, my tooth discoloration seems to be permanent.  I used just about every “whitening” toothpaste and mouthwash product on the market and saw little if any improvement.</em></p>
						<p><em>A co-worker of mine recently recommended to do some research online before making my next purchase. As an elementary school teacher with a modest salary and a sizeable mortgage, cost was a major concern.  While searching the Web I found a few online teeth whitening companies giving away Risk Free Trials where you only had to pay a few dollars for shipping.  I ordered two products, <a href="./step-1.php" target="_blank">Pearl-E-Whites Pen</a> and <a href="./step-2.php" target="_blank">Pearl-E-Whites Tray</a>, both of which had 9/10 ratings and positive feedback from all users.  After using the first product the results were noticeable, but after following with the second product I had a celebrity white smile.  I’m far from a medical expert, but it appears that each product focused on <strong>DIFFERENT</strong> parts of the problem and that the second one put the whitening effect into overdrive.  By using them both in a row I had absolutely unbelievable results.  I can’t believe companies are practically giving these products away!</em></p>
						<p>Jessica: “I’m an optimist and always look for the silver lining in any situation.  While this recession has negatively impacted me like everyone else, my savvy shopping skills got me the smile I always wanted.” </p>
						<p>Online teeth whitening companies are <strong>DESPERATE</strong> for new customers and are giving away Risk Free Trials as a way to find new clients and offload excess inventory. You can and should take advantage of the downturn in the economy just like Jessica.</p>
						<p>When asked to elaborate on her discovery Jessica said: </p>
						<p>“I was impressed with the results after the first 3 days – but once I saw my teeth after a week, I was absolutely blown away… I knew I was onto something. The trick is to use TWO trial products that compliment each other TOGETHER to give yourself a whitening comparable to that of your favorite actress.”</p>
						<h1><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1>
						<p>If you are interested in using Jessica’s trick, we have provided links and coupon code information for the two products she used. Remember, to get results like Jessica’s, you will want to use BOTH products together. The coupon codes reduce shipping costs to under $3 TOTAL!</p>
						<p>Good Luck with your teeth whitening!</p>

I took a pic when I got the products a week ago (Pearl-E-Whites Pen came first, had to wait for the other one for an extra day), used them for about a week and just took another pic a few minutes ago. Here they are. Honestly, this is unbelievable, all I have to say is WOW.</span></p>
