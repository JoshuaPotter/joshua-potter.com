																		<SPAN class="introtext">Amidst the second worst recession in  history, thrifty 
																			consumers are turning to the <SPAN class="bold">internet</SPAN> to take advantage of special offers.</SPAN>
																		<BR>
																			<BR>Jessica, a school teacher and full time mom, is one such consumer. It all started about three months ago when she bought an authentic Coach purse on sale for only $55 (75% off the retail price). She was determined to seek out other great offers and
																				recently made her best find. Jessica discovered a clever way of combining two different teeth whitening offers from two different companies –
																				<A href="step-1.php" target="_blank">Whitening Coach</A> and
																				<A href="step-2.php" target="_blank">Bella At Home</A> – to get results similar to that of a professional whitening done by a dentist. Rather then spending $800 at her local dentist to attain a sexy smile,
																				<SPAN class="bold"> she was able 
																					to do so for less than $3 by using free trial offers she found online.<BR><BR>
																					<P>Jessica: "I like to consider myself a smart shopper, always finding          
																						the best deal for my money. My online teeth whitening discovery was          
																						without a doubt one of the best finds I made this year."</P>
																					<P><SPAN class="bold"><SPAN class="underline"><STRONG>How did Jessica wind up 
																						with yellow teeth? </STRONG></SPAN></SPAN>
																					</P>
																					<P>
																						<SPAN class="blockquote"><EM>While my mom always told me be to be          
																							proud of who I am and what I look like, I have always been self          
																							conscious about my yellow teeth. Truthfully, I have no one to blame for          
																							this problem but myself. I smoked for 8 years, drink 2 cups of coffee a          
																							day (only way to stay awake at work), and love a glass of red wine to          
																							help me sleep at night. Furthermore, I would be lying if I said that I          
																							brushed my teeth 3 times a day every day. While I recently quit smoking          
																							and have cut back on the amount of coffee I drink, my tooth          
																							discoloration seems to be permanent. I used just about every          
																							"whitening" toothpaste and mouthwash product on the market and saw          
																							little if any improvement.</EM></SPAN>
																					</P>
																					<P>
																						<EM><SPAN class="blockquote">A co-worker of mine recently recommended         
																							to do some research online before making my next purchase. As an          
																							elementary school teacher with a modest salary and a sizeable mortgage,          
																							cost was a major concern. While searching the Web I found a few online          
																							teeth whitening companies giving away free trials where you only had to          
																							pay a few dollars for shipping. I ordered two products, <A href="step-1.php" 
target="_blank">Whitening Coach</A> and <A href="step-2.php" 
										   target="_blank">Bella At Home</A>,          both of which had 9/10 ratings and 
																							positive feedback from all users.          After using the first product the 
																							results were noticeable, but after          following with the second product I 
																							had a celebrity white smile. I'm          far from a medical expert, but it 
																							appears that each product focused on <STRONG>DIFFERENT</STRONG> parts of the 
																							problem and that the second one put the whitening effect          into 
																							overdrive. By using them both in a row I had absolutely          unbelievable 
																							results. I can't believe companies are practically giving          these 
																							products away! </SPAN></EM>

																								</P>
																								<P>When asked to elaborate on her discovery Jessica said:</P>"I was impressed with the results after the first 3 days – but once I saw my teeth after a week, I was absolutely blown away… I knew I was onto something. The trick is to use TWO trial products
																								that compliment each other
																								<SPAN class="bold">TOGETHER</SPAN> to give yourself a whitening comparable to that of your favorite actress."

																								<P>The Consumer Lifestyles team would like to thank Jessica for this amazing teeth whitening tip. If you are interested in using Jessica's trick, we have provided links and coupon code information for the two products she used. Remember, to get results
