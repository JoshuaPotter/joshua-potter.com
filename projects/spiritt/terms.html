				<div class="section">
					<p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") and our Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") govern your use of Service Technologies, Inc,'s ("ST") website located at www.getservice.io ("Site") and our issue resolution service accessible via our Site and our mobile device application ("App"). To make these Terms easier to read, the Site, our services and App are collectively called the "Services."

By using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and by our Privacy Policy. If you don't agree, don't use the Services.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<p><strong>Changes to Terms or Services</strong></p>
					<p>We may modify the Terms at any time. If we do so, we'll let you know by posting the modified Terms on the Site or through other communications. If you continue to use the Services after we have posted modified Terms on the Site, you'll be bound by the modified Terms. If you don't agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then you may not use the Services anymore. Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<p><strong>Services</strong></p>
					<p>Via the Services, ST will try to resolve issues you have with third party vendors. You can communicate with us about an issue or problem (the "Issue") you are having with your third party vendor or service provider ("Vendor") via the functionality of the Services and we will diligently work with the Vendor to try to resolve the Issue and communicate the solution to you. By sending us a request to resolve your Issue, you are authorizing us to communicate with the Vendor, and to try to resolve the Issue on your behalf. In order to use the Services, you'll need to provide us with some personal information, as described in our Privacy Policy. In addition, you'll provide us with information related to the Issue upon our request (e.g. the confirmation number of the transaction you need help with or a copy of the email confirmation from the Vendor). We reserve the right to accept or decline your request to solve an Issue at any stage, in our sole discretion, and will communicate our decision in this regard to you within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

					<p>You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the right (either as yourself or as an authorized representative, if you are representing some other person or entity) to authorize us to resolve the Issue with the Vendor, and (ii) you are not using the Services for any unlawful purpose or illegal activities. We will never agree on any settlement proposed by Vendor (e.g. getting part of the refund or credit for future purchases instead of getting a full refund for an unused ticket) without your prior consent. Though we are confident and optimistic about our ability to resolve your Issues, we may not always be able to do so, so, your Issues may remain unresolved, and you will not hold us liable in this regard. You may pursue other remedies, including legal remedies, available to you against Vendors. We are not way responsible if your legal remedy against a Vendor is barred because you didn't take timely legal action.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<p><strong>Who May Use the Services</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Eligibility</strong></p>
					<p>You may use the Services only if you are 18 years or older and are not barred from using the Services under applicable law.

					<p><strong>Registration and Your Information</strong></p>
					<p>You don't need to create an account to use our Services. However, you may register with us by creating an account ("Account") via the Site or, if we so allow, through your account with certain third-party social networking services such as Facebook or Twitter (each, an "SNS Account"). If you choose the SNS Account option we'll create your Account by extracting from your SNS Account certain personal information that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access.</p>

<p>You agree to keep your Account password private. You're responsible for all activities that occur under your Account, whether or not you know about them.</p>
